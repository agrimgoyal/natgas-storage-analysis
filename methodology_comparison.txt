METHODOLOGY COMPARISON: OLD (LOOK-AHEAD) vs NEW (EXPANDING WINDOW)
================================================================================
Generated: 2026-02-04

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
================================================================================

The original methodology calculated mean and standard deviation using the ENTIRE
dataset (2010-2026), then applied these values retroactively to detect historical
deviations. This creates LOOK-AHEAD BIAS - using information from the future to
make decisions about the past.

The NEW methodology uses an EXPANDING WINDOW approach:
  - Mean and std are calculated using ONLY data available up to each observation
  - Minimum 52 weeks of history required before flagging any events
  - Z-scores are recalculated at each point using only prior information
  - This makes the analysis realistic for live trading applications

KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. MORE EVENTS DETECTED (+33.8%)
   - Old: 1,439 events
   - New: 1,925 events

   The expanding window approach detects MORE events because early deviations
   that appeared "normal" when measured against the full dataset are now
   correctly identified as significant when measured against only the data
   available at that time.

2. DIRECTIONAL BIAS HOLDS AND STRENGTHENS
   - Old: 86.4% of events followed by price increases
   - New: 89.2% of events followed by price increases

   The bullish bias following deviation events is STRONGER with the corrected
   methodology, suggesting the trading signal is robust and not an artifact
   of look-ahead bias.

3. Z-SCORE/PRICE CORRELATION MODERATELY WEAKER
   - Old: 0.342 (moderate positive)
   - New: 0.268 (weak-moderate positive)

   The correlation between deviation magnitude and price change magnitude
   is somewhat weaker but still positive. This suggests that while larger
   deviations do tend to precede larger price moves, the relationship is
   not as strong as the biased methodology suggested.

4. EXTREME EVENTS STILL DETECTED (AND STRONGER)

   2014 Polar Vortex (Jan-Mar 2014):
   - Old: 5 events, max |Z-Score| = 3.74
   - New: 5 events, max |Z-Score| = 4.40 (+17.6%)

   The Polar Vortex events are STRONGER in the new methodology because
   the early-2014 readings are compared to only ~4 years of prior data
   rather than 16 years including the recovery period.

   Dec 2022 Winter Storm Elliott:
   - Old: 49 events, max |Z-Score| = 7.23
   - New: 49 events, max |Z-Score| = 7.99 (+10.5%)

   Winter Storm Elliott events are also stronger when measured against
   only pre-event history.

INTERPRETATION FOR TRADING
================================================================================

GOOD NEWS:
- The core finding (deviation events followed by price increases) is ROBUST
- The directional bias is actually STRONGER with unbiased methodology
- Extreme weather events are still clearly detectable
- The methodology is now suitable for live trading applications

CAUTION:
- The Z-score/price correlation is weaker than previously thought
- More events are flagged, which may increase false positive rate
- Historical backtest results may differ from live trading performance

RECOMMENDATION:
Use the expanding window methodology for any forward-looking analysis or
trading strategy development. The old methodology overstated the Z-score/price
correlation but understated the directional bias, creating a mixed picture
of the strategy's true characteristics.

DETAILED Z-SCORE DISTRIBUTION (NEW METHODOLOGY)
================================================================================

Mean |Z-Score|:           3.12
Max |Z-Score|:            10.09
Events with |Z| > 2:      1,925 (by definition - threshold)
Events with |Z| > 3:      747 (38.8%)
Events with |Z| > 4:      308 (16.0%)
Events with |Z| > 5:      142 (7.4%)
