METHODOLOGY COMPARISON & FINAL ANALYSIS
================================================================================
Generated: 2026-02-04 (Final version with full price history)

================================================================================
CRITICAL FINDING: PREVIOUS "BULLISH SIGNAL" WAS SPURIOUS
================================================================================

The initial analysis showed 89% of deviation events were followed by price
increases. THIS WAS AN ARTIFACT OF INCOMPLETE DATA.

The original price data only covered 2022-2026, which happened to be a period
of generally rising natural gas prices. When using the FULL price history
(2010-2026), the directional bias DISAPPEARS:

                                2022-2026 ONLY    2010-2026 FULL
                                --------------    --------------
Average price change:           +8.35%            -1.01%
Median price change:            +10.30%           -1.05%
Directional bias (positive):    89.3%             46.1%
Z-Score/Price correlation:      0.246             0.120

CONCLUSION: Regional storage deviations do NOT predict price direction.
The apparent "bullish signal" was entirely due to sampling bias.

================================================================================
METHODOLOGY FIXES APPLIED
================================================================================

1. LOOK-AHEAD BIAS (Fixed)
   - Original: Used full dataset mean/std retroactively
   - Fixed: Expanding window calculates stats using only prior data

2. CURRENT-OBSERVATION CONTAMINATION (Fixed)
   - Original expanding window included current value in mean/std
   - Fixed: Added .shift(1) to exclude current observation

3. PRICE DATA COVERAGE (Fixed)
   - Original: Only 2022-2026 (bullish period)
   - Fixed: Full 2010-2026 history (4,190 daily observations)

================================================================================
FINAL RESULTS (CORRECT METHODOLOGY + FULL DATA)
================================================================================

DEVIATION EVENTS:
  Total events detected:        1,952
  - Correlation breaks:         1,730
  - Ratio deviations:           222

PRICE IMPACT:
  Average price change:         -1.01%
  Median price change:          -1.05%
  Positive movements:           900 (46.1%)
  Negative movements:           1,052 (53.9%)
  Z-Score/Price correlation:    0.120 (very weak)

EXTREME EVENTS:
  2014 Polar Vortex:
    - Events: 5
    - Max |Z-Score|: 4.63
    - Avg price change: -11.51%

  Dec 2022 Winter Storm Elliott:
    - Events: 49
    - Max |Z-Score|: 8.42
    - Avg price change: -34.56%

Note: Both major weather events were followed by price DECREASES,
contrary to what limited data suggested.

YEARLY BREAKDOWN OF PRICE CHANGES FOLLOWING DEVIATIONS
================================================================================

Year    Avg Change    Events
----    ----------    ------
2011    -2.78%        150
2012    +5.06%        141
2013    -4.22%        59
2014    -2.37%        18
2015    -0.26%        87
2016    +3.06%        398
2017    -0.74%        246
2018    +1.93%        115
2019    -2.93%        116
2020    +4.67%        67
2021    -4.29%        114
2022    -11.69%       121
2023    -9.81%        145
2024    -1.78%        151
2025    +16.91%       24

No consistent pattern - results vary by year based on overall market conditions.

================================================================================
WHAT THE ANALYSIS DOES SHOW
================================================================================

1. DEVIATIONS ARE DETECTABLE
   The methodology successfully identifies unusual regional storage patterns.
   Extreme weather events (Polar Vortex, Winter Storm Elliott) register with
   high z-scores (4-8+ standard deviations).

2. NO DIRECTIONAL SIGNAL
   Knowing that a deviation occurred does NOT tell you which way prices will
   move. The 46/54 split is essentially random.

3. WEAK MAGNITUDE CORRELATION
   The correlation between deviation magnitude and price change magnitude is
   only 0.12 - essentially no relationship.

4. DEVIATIONS MAY INDICATE VOLATILITY
   While direction is unpredictable, deviations may signal increased price
   volatility (further analysis needed).

================================================================================
LESSONS LEARNED
================================================================================

1. ALWAYS USE COMPLETE DATA
   Limited time periods can create spurious patterns that disappear with
   fuller datasets.

2. BEWARE OF LOOK-AHEAD BIAS
   Using future information to analyze past events creates false confidence.

3. VALIDATE AGAINST OUT-OF-SAMPLE DATA
   The 2022-2026 "bullish signal" would have failed immediately when tested
   against 2010-2021 data.

4. CHECK YOUR EXPANDING WINDOWS
   Including the current observation in rolling/expanding calculations is a
   subtle bug that dampens extreme values.
