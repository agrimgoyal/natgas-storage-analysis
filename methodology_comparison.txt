NATURAL GAS STORAGE DEVIATION ANALYSIS - FINAL FINDINGS
================================================================================
Generated: 2026-02-04

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

Initial analysis suggested 89% of deviation events were followed by price
increases. This was SPURIOUS - an artifact of limited price data (2022-2026).

With full price history (2010-2026), the OVERALL directional bias disappears
(46% positive vs 54% negative). HOWEVER, analyzing by DIRECTION of deviation
reveals two statistically significant trading signals:

BULLISH SIGNAL: East Region Undersupply
  - Win rate: 75.9% (out-of-sample: 89.5%)
  - Avg return: +5.61%
  - Events: 83

BEARISH SIGNAL: Pacific Correlation Breakdown
  - Win rate: 73.5% bearish (out-of-sample: 78.0%)
  - Avg return: -9.70%
  - Events: 378

Both signals are highly statistically significant (p < 0.0001) and hold
out-of-sample.

================================================================================
METHODOLOGY FIXES APPLIED
================================================================================

1. Look-ahead bias: Fixed with expanding window
2. Current-observation contamination: Fixed with .shift(1)
3. Price data coverage: Extended from 2022-2026 to 2010-2026
4. Analysis granularity: Separated by deviation direction

================================================================================
DETAILED FINDINGS
================================================================================

SIGNAL 1: EAST REGION UNDERSUPPLY (BULLISH)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When East region storage is LOW relative to the rest of the country
(negative Z-score on East/Total or East/Midwest ratios):

                        Training        Test            Full Sample
                        (2011-2018)     (2019-2025)
Events:                 64              19              83
Avg price change:       +3.88%          +11.44%         +5.61%
Win rate (positive):    71.9%           89.5%           75.9%

Statistical significance: p < 0.000001 (binomial test)

ECONOMIC INTERPRETATION:
- East region is the major demand center (Northeast population, heating)
- Undersupply there creates price pressure = bullish
- Signal is STRONGER out-of-sample, suggesting real effect

SIGNAL 2: PACIFIC CORRELATION BREAKDOWN (BEARISH)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Pacific region's correlation with other regions drops significantly:

                        Training        Test            Full Sample
                        (2011-2018)     (2019-2025)
Events:                 151             227             378
Avg price change:       -5.16%          -12.72%         -9.70%
Win rate (bearish):     66.9%           78.0%           73.5%

Statistical significance: p < 0.0000000001 (binomial test)

ECONOMIC INTERPRETATION:
- Pacific region is geographically isolated (limited pipeline capacity)
- When it de-correlates, may signal regional oversupply
- Isolated excess doesn't flow east = prices fall nationally
- Signal is STRONGER out-of-sample, suggesting real effect

SIGNAL 3: EAST REGION OVERSUPPLY (BEARISH)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When East region storage is HIGH relative to Midwest
(positive Z-score on East/Midwest ratio):

Events:                 28
Avg price change:       -3.25%
Win rate (bearish):     71.4%

Note: Smaller sample size, but directionally consistent with Signal 1.

================================================================================
NON-SIGNALS (NO PREDICTIVE VALUE)
================================================================================

Overall correlation breaks: 44.7% positive (no signal)
Overall ratio deviations: ~50% positive (no signal)
Z-score magnitude: 0.12 correlation with price change (very weak)

The key insight is that DIRECTION of deviation matters, not just occurrence.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED TRADING STRATEGY
================================================================================

LONG SIGNALS (expect price increase):
  - East/Total Lower 48 ratio drops >2 std below expanding mean
  - East/Midwest ratio drops >2 std below expanding mean

  Expected: +5.6% over 4 weeks, 76% win rate

SHORT SIGNALS (expect price decrease):
  - Pacific correlation with any major region drops >2 std
  - East/Midwest ratio rises >2 std above expanding mean

  Expected: -9.7% over 4 weeks (Pacific), 74% win rate

POSITION SIZING:
  - Z-score magnitude has weak correlation with returns
  - Size based on signal presence, not deviation magnitude

================================================================================
DATA QUALITY NOTES
================================================================================

- Storage data: 839 weeks (2010-2026)
- Price data: 4,190 daily observations (2010-2026)
- Total deviation events: 1,952
- Events with valid price impact: 1,952

================================================================================
LESSONS LEARNED
================================================================================

1. Limited data creates spurious patterns (89% -> 46% with full history)
2. Aggregate analysis hides directional signals
3. Economic intuition should guide hypothesis testing
4. Out-of-sample validation is essential
5. Both bullish and bearish signals exist - need to analyze separately
